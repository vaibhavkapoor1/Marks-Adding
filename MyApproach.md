# Marks-Adding
Mini Project 4
In this mini project, we are provided with a csv(Comma Separated Values) file in which the data of various students is present.
This data has roll numbers corresponding to the marks of different students. 
The roll numbers are repetitive in the data.
We have to write a program such that there is only one unique roll number and the corresponding marks are added up. The resultant unique roll number along with total marks is stored in a new output file named as final_marks.csv
For adding the numbers we have to select unique roll numbers and perform sum on the marks column. We filter the data to generate a roll number only once and store it in roll_number.
Both the columns, Roll Number and Marks are appended to the data frame sum_marks_df. 
Now the data frame is added and stored in an output file
